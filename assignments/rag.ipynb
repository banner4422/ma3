    "Compared to the code from the `rag_guide.ipynb`, which used simple similarity search for the retrieval, our implementation adopts Maximum Marginal Relevance (MMR) for retrieval. MMR improves the diversity of retrieved documents, which means it does not just fetch the most similar documents but instead a set of documents that are diverse but relevant to the query, which improves coverage and thereby improves the answer of potential complex queries. This improves context and decreases potential overfitting on similar documents by not potentially fetching very similar documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the retrieval settings, with setting `\"lambda_mult\"` to `0.8` we set a certain threshold for the diversity of the documents, where 1 would mean only the most similar document is returned, so 0.8 balances similarity and diversity in the fetched documents. `\"score_threshold\"` to `0.8` is set to ensure that only documents with a high similarity score are returned, which helps to filter out irrelevant documents.\n",

    "At last, we changed the prompt design a little bit by setting rules and making the tone perhaps more strict. Making it explicit that it should only ground its answer on the provided context. To ensure all relevant information is included in the answer, we intentionally omitted the instruction to keep to an x amount of sentences.\n",

    "The evaluation result on the baseline code copied from the guide resulted in `{'retrieval_quality': 0.98, 'answer_correctness': 0.94, 'hallucination': 0.24}` whereas our implementation resulted in `{'retrieval_quality': 0.98, 'answer_correctness': 0.94, 'hallucination': 0.2}` which sure is mostly the same, but the hallucination score is lower which is positive, and perhaps a result of a stricter prompt design and the MMR retrieval."
